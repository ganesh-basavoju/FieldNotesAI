AI-Powered Field Notes & Action Item System
Requirements & Architecture — Version 3.0 (Production-Ready)
Executive Purpose
This system captures live, in-person conversations occurring in the field (project managers, subcontractors, homeowners, vendors, internal staff), transforms them into clean, structured, legally defensible meeting notes, extracts actionable commitments, and integrates them directly into the company’s job management and communication workflows.
The system is designed for real-world construction environments, prioritizing:
Offline-first reliability
Legal compliance (California all-party consent)
Human-in-the-loop review
Auditability and defensibility
High trust and low friction for field users
1. Core System Architecture Overview
