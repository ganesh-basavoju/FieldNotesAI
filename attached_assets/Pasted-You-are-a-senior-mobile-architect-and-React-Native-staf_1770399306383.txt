You are a senior mobile architect and React Native staff engineer.

Your task is to DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT a production-ready MOBILE APP FRONTEND ONLY.
NO backend logic. NO AI logic. NO mock-only demo shortcuts.

The app is an offline-first field capture system for construction teams:
photos + voice notes → AI-generated tasks and evidence links.

AI processing already exists and is handled via n8n webhook.
Your job is to build the mobile app that CAPTURES, STORES, DISPLAYS, and REVIEWS data.

────────────────────────
CORE CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
────────────────────────
• Mobile App ONLY (React Native)
• Offline-first must work with ZERO network
• Data must survive long walkthroughs (30–60 min)
• Must scale to hundreds of assets per project
• UX must feel premium, fast, and deliberate (enterprise-grade)
• Deterministic behavior > “AI magic”

────────────────────────
TECH STACK (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────
Framework:
- React Native (latest stable)
- New Architecture enabled (Fabric + TurboModules)
- TypeScript everywhere

Navigation & Gestures:
- React Navigation (native-stack)
- react-native-gesture-handler
- react-native-reanimated

UI System:
- NativeWind (Tailwind-style)
- React Native Paper
- react-native-bottom-sheet

State & Sync:
- Zustand (local/global UI state)
- TanStack Query (server + webhook sync)

Offline Storage:
- MMKV (queues, flags, job states)
- WatermelonDB (projects, media, transcript segments, tasks, links)

Media:
- react-native-vision-camera (photo/video)
- react-native-audio-recorder-player (audio)
- react-native-background-upload (uploads when online)

Monitoring:
- Sentry
- Firebase Crashlytics

────────────────────────
DESIGN SYSTEM (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY)
────────────────────────
Theme: Luxury Black + White + Purple Gradient

Backgrounds:
- Global: #000000
- Dashboard: #050505
- Cards: white/5 opacity with blur

Text:
- Default: white
- Muted: gray-400
- Active / Selected: purple / indigo

Accents:
- Indigo → Purple gradients for:
  • main headings
  • active tabs
  • AI confidence badges

NO light theme.
Dark mode only.
High contrast.
Minimalist.
No visual clutter.

────────────────────────
CORE USER FLOWS (BUILD THESE)
────────────────────────

1) Project & Area Context
- Always show current Project + Area at top
- Area selector must be 1-tap (Kitchen / Bath / Roof / Exterior / Other)

2) Capture Modes
A) Photo + Speak (DEFAULT)
- Take photo/video
- Immediately hold-to-speak
- Audio auto-attaches to that media

B) Walkthrough Mode
- Start session
- Continuous audio recording
- Rapid photos/videos
- End session → data grouped

C) Voice Note Only
- Record audio without media
- Area still required

3) Offline Behavior
- App launches offline
- All media/audio stored locally
- Visible status per asset:
  Captured ✓ | Syncing ⟳ | Uploaded ✔ | Failed ⚠
- Manual retry + Wi-Fi-only toggle

4) AI Webhook Integration
- On upload completion, POST to:
  https://n8n.srv1116545.hstgr.cloud/webhook-test/56de15fe-5286-4bda-880a-e67c5aa87aa4

Payload must include:
- project_id
- area
- media_asset_ids
- audio_note_ids
- local timestamps

- Poll or receive webhook result (simulated)
- Store returned:
  • transcript segments
  • tasks
  • confidence scores
  • suggested links

5) Session Review Screen (CRITICAL)
Layout:
- LEFT: media timeline (photos/videos)
- RIGHT: task list + transcript snippets

Each task must show:
- linked media thumbnails
- linked transcript lines
- confidence badge

User actions:
- accept/remove links
- edit task title/description
- reassign area
- mark task status

All edits must be tracked:
- AI suggestion vs human edit
- timestamp + user

6) Task System
Task fields:
- title
- description
- status (Open / In Progress / Blocked / Done)
- priority
- due date (optional)
- tags (trade, phase, area)
- linked evidence

Views:
- Project task list
- Area-based punch list
- “Today” view
- Blocked items

────────────────────────
DATA MODELS (DO NOT SIMPLIFY)
────────────────────────
Entities:
- Project
- Area
- MediaAsset
- AudioNote
- TranscriptSegment
- TaskItem
- EvidenceLink

Links must be explicit join tables with:
- link_type (strong / suggested / possible)
- link_score
- created_by (system/user)

────────────────────────
OUTPUT FORMAT
────────────────────────
1) App architecture overview
2) Folder structure
3) Core data models (TypeScript)
4) Key screens (with component breakdowns)
5) Offline + sync logic explanation
6) Webhook integration example
7) What is mocked vs real
8) What is V1 vs V2

DO NOT:
- invent backend endpoints
- simplify offline logic
- skip review UI
- gloss over storage

BUILD THIS LIKE IT WILL BE USED BY REAL FIELD TECHS,
IN RAIN, GLOVES ON, NO SIGNAL, WITH LEGAL CONSEQUENCES.
