version1:
AI-Powered Field Notes & Action Item System
Requirements & Architecture — Version 3.0 (Production-Ready)
Executive Purpose
This system captures live, in-person conversations occurring in the field (project managers, subcontractors, homeowners, vendors, internal staff), transforms them into clean, structured, legally defensible meeting notes, extracts actionable commitments, and integrates them directly into the company’s job management and communication workflows.
The system is designed for real-world construction environments, prioritizing:
Offline-first reliability
Legal compliance (California all-party consent)
Human-in-the-loop review
Auditability and defensibility
High trust and low friction for field users

version2:
AI-Powered Field Photo + Voice Notes + To-Do Platform
(CompanyCam-style, but with AI-driven voice → tasks + automatic linking)
1. Core Objectives (Non-Negotiable)
The system must:
Capture photos/videos and spoken notes in the field (mobile-first)
Convert speech to structured outputs:
tasks / to-dos
punch lists
change order candidates
questions to office / adjuster
daily logs
Link everything (voice note ↔ photos ↔ video ↔ tasks ↔ project phase ↔ room/area)
Work offline, then sync with full chain-of-custody metadata

2. Core Data Model (Everything Must Be Linkable)
Your devs should implement explicit entities:
Required Entities
Project
Location/Area (room, elevation, zone, “Kitchen”, “Roof”, “South Wall”)
MediaAsset (photo/video)
AudioNote (raw audio + transcript)
TranscriptSegment (timestamped chunks)
TaskItem (structured to-do)
Observation (damage note, scope note, concern)
ConversationThread (comments / clarifications)
EvidencePackage (export/report bundle)
Required Relationships
Project ↔ Area ↔ MediaAsset
MediaAsset ↔ AudioNote (one-to-many)
AudioNote ↔ TranscriptSegment
TranscriptSegment ↔ TaskItem (many-to-many)
TaskItem ↔ MediaAsset (many-to-many)
This matters because a single spoken note often references multiple photos and vice versa.

3. Mobile Capture Requirements (Photos + “Speak” Mode)
Capture Modes
Photo/Video Capture (standard)
Photo + Speak (recommended default)
take photo → immediately press and hold “Speak”
voice note automatically attaches to that photo
Walkthrough Mode
continuous audio recording + rapid photos/videos
system groups all media into a “session”
later AI auto-links transcript segments to media timestamps
Offline-First
All photos/videos/audio stored locally until sync
Local queue + retry logic
Visible sync status per asset

4. AI Speech-to-Structure Pipeline (Critical)
This is the new “engine.”
Input Types
Raw audio captured on mobile
Optional: call recordings or meeting recordings (Phase 2)
Output Types (Must Generate)
From each audio note / walkthrough:
Transcript (with timestamps)
Summary (1–3 bullets)
Task items with:
title
description
due date (if stated)
priority (if implied)
assignee suggestion (optional)
category tag (demo, drying, rebuild, billing, insurance, etc.)
Issues/risks (e.g., “possible mold”, “structural concern”)
Change order candidates (if user says anything like “owner wants…”)
Questions to send to office (“Need approval”, “Need electrician quote”)
Requirements for the AI Output
Every structured item must include:
source_audio_note_id
source_transcript_segment_ids
confidence score (0–1)
Items must be editable by humans, with change tracking (AI suggestion vs human edits)

5. Automatic Linking Logic (Voice ↔ Photos/Videos ↔ Tasks)
This is where you win or lose.
Linking Rules (Must Implement)
The system must auto-link in at least these ways:
Direct attachment
If user records audio immediately after a photo/video, link it automatically.
Time proximity linking (Walkthrough Mode)
If transcript segment time overlaps a photo timestamp window (e.g., within ±20 seconds), link.
Location/Area linking
If user selected “Kitchen” area, all assets + tasks inherit that context.
Keyword/entity linking
If transcript mentions “south wall” or “master bath,” link to assets tagged similarly.
Manual linking override
User can add/remove links easily:
“Attach this note to these 3 photos”
“This task belongs to roof video”
UI Requirement
In a photo view: show linked tasks + transcript snippets
In a task view: show linked photos/videos + transcript evidence

6. To-Do / Punch List System (Not Optional)
This is not a lightweight checkbox list — it must be operational.
Task Fields
Title
Description
Status: Open / In Progress / Blocked / Done
Priority: Low/Med/High
Due date
Assignee (internal user)
Tags (trade + phase + insurance)
Linked evidence (photos/videos/audio/transcript segments)
Task Views
Project task list
Area-based punch list
“Today” view per user
“Blocked items” dashboard
Actions
Assign
Comment
Attach media
Mark complete (with optional completion photo requirement)

7. “Daily Log” and “Job Diary” (AI-Generated)
Per project per day, the system must generate:
Work performed summary
Issues encountered
Materials delivered
Trades on site (if spoken)
Customer requests (auto-flagged)
Pending tasks
This becomes a defensible timeline for insurance and disputes.

8. Reporting & Exports (Evidence Packages)
Generate PDFs / bundles that include:
Selected photos with captions
Linked task list (open/closed)
Transcript excerpts for key issues
Timestamps + user attribution
Optional “Change Order Candidates” section
Export formats:
PDF
Zip bundle (original media + CSV + JSON audit)

9. Audit Trail & Chain of Custody (Expanded)
In addition to normal photo chain-of-custody, also store:
Audio capture time vs upload time
Transcript generation time
AI model version (or internal “pipeline version”)
Human edits to tasks and notes (diff log)

10. API-First Requirements (Mandatory)
APIs
Create/update projects
Upload media/audio
Create transcript + structured extraction job
Retrieve transcript segments
Create/update tasks
Link/unlink assets
Generate daily logs
Generate evidence packages
Webhooks
media.uploaded
audio.transcribed
ai.tasks.generated
task.updated
report.generated

11. Security & Privacy
Encryption at rest + in transit
Signed links w/ expiration
Role-based access
External sharing controls (read-only, time-limited)
Optional PII redaction mode (Phase 2)

12. Acceptance Criteria (What “Done” Means)
A field tech can:
Take 20 photos, speak naturally (“Demo this cabinet, call plumber, homeowner wants upgraded tile”)
End the walkthrough
The office sees:
photos organized by area/time
transcript + summary
a clean, editable task list with evidence linked
change order candidates flagged
Everything is timestamped and exportable in a dispute-ready format

Phase 2 (High Value Add-Ons)
Auto-classify photos (water damage, mold, smoke, structural)
“Missing documentation” alerts (“No moisture map photo for Day 2”)
Auto-generate scope notes / estimating checklist from tasks
Create change order drafts from flagged items and link photos into the CO
Below is a one-page developer brief (tight, implementation-oriented) that explains the AI linking algorithm, thresholds, and UI flow so your engineers don’t build a “cool demo” that becomes a messy database.

One-Page Developer Brief
AI Voice → Transcript → Tasks → Evidence Linking (Photos/Videos)
Goal
When a tech captures photos/videos + spoken notes, the system must automatically produce:
a clean transcript
a structured task list / punch list
strong evidence links between tasks ↔ transcript snippets ↔ media, with easy human correction.

1) The Field Capture UX (The “Happy Path”)
Modes (all must exist)
A) Photo + Speak (default)
User takes photo/video → taps “Hold to Speak”
Creates an AudioNote directly linked to that media asset
B) Walkthrough Mode
Start session → continuous audio recording
User captures photos/videos throughout
Session ends → auto-process and auto-link
C) Voice Note Only
“Kitchen note: …” without media
Still creates tasks; can be linked later
Required UI guardrails
Always show current Project + Area at the top
Area selector must be 1 tap (“Kitchen / Bath / Roof / Exterior / Other”)
Show a lightweight “Captured ✓ / Syncing ⟳ / Uploaded ︎” badge per asset

2) Processing Pipeline (Async Jobs)
Job stages (must be explicit and resumable)
Upload raw media + audio (preserve originals)
Transcribe audio → TranscriptSegments (timestamped)
Extract structured outputs:
Tasks
Issues/Risks
Change-order candidates
Summary + Daily Log bullets
Link:
AudioNote ↔ MediaAssets
TranscriptSegments ↔ MediaAssets
TaskItems ↔ MediaAssets + TranscriptSegments
Notify via webhooks + UI updates
Required metadata on every AI artifact
pipeline_version
created_at_utc
source_audio_note_id
source_transcript_segment_ids
confidence_score (0–1)

3) Linking Algorithm (Deterministic First, AI Second)
Why: reliability > magic
Build links using a tiered scoring system. AI should enhance, not replace.
3.1 Evidence Link Score (0–100)
Compute a score for linking a TranscriptSegment (or TaskItem) to a MediaAsset:
A) Direct attachment (Photo+Speak)
If AudioNote created from a specific photo/video: +80 (auto-link, “locked” unless user removes)
B) Time proximity (Walkthrough Mode)
Δt = abs(media.capture_time - segment.midpoint_time)
Thresholds:
Δt ≤ 10s: +45
10–25s: +30
25–60s: +15
60s: +0
C) Area match
If segment/task has area tag (explicit user selection or AI inferred) and matches media area: +20
If project-only match: +5
D) Keyword/entity match
Extract entities from segment/task:
rooms/areas (“kitchen”, “master bath”)
building parts (“baseboard”, “drywall”, “cabinet”)
trades (“plumber”, “electrician”)
If entity overlap with media tags/captions: +15
E) User confirmation history (learning)
If user repeatedly links similar phrases to similar areas/components: +5–10
(simple per-company dictionary; no “training” required)
3.2 Link decisions
Score ≥ 70 → auto-link (strong)
Score 45–69 → auto-link but mark “suggested” (UI badge)
Score 25–44 → show as “possible link” in review
Score < 25 → do not link
3.3 “Linking unit”
Link at TranscriptSegment level (timestamped chunks)
Tasks link to multiple transcript segments
Tasks link to multiple media assets

4) Task Extraction Rules (Make Tasks Usable)
Task creation heuristics
Create a TaskItem when the transcript contains:
imperatives: “need to”, “do”, “fix”, “remove”, “install”, “call”, “schedule”
assignments: “have John…”, “tell office…”
deadlines: “today”, “tomorrow”, “before inspection”
Task schema (minimum)
title (short verb phrase)
description (what/where/why)
status (Open default)
priority (default Medium; bump if “urgent”, “ASAP”, “before inspection”)
due_date (only if explicitly stated; otherwise null)
suggested_assignee (optional; based on trade keywords)
tags: {phase, trade, area}
evidence_links: media_asset_ids + transcript_segment_ids
Avoid junk tasks
Do not create tasks for purely descriptive statements unless there’s a clear action
Deduplicate similar tasks within the same session (string similarity + area match)

5) Review UI (Where Humans Correct the AI Fast)
The “Session Review” screen (must exist)
After processing a walkthrough:
Left: timeline of photos/videos
Right: generated tasks + key transcript snippets
Each task shows linked thumbnails (tap to add/remove)
“Accept all suggested links” + “Edit tasks” controls
In-photo view
Show:
linked tasks (open first)
linked transcript snippets (tap to play audio at that timestamp)
In-task view
Show:
linked evidence gallery
“source” transcript lines
play audio from the exact segment
Human edits must write back:
link_added_by_user / link_removed_by_user
task_edited_by_user
edit timestamp + user id

6) Suggested Implementation (Simple + Durable)
Services/modules
Media service (store originals + thumbnails)
Audio/transcription service (asynchronous)
AI extraction service (tasks/issues/summaries)
Linking service (scoring + decisions)
Tasks service (CRUD + RBAC)
Reporting service (evidence packages)
Database hint
Store links in a join table with:
link_type (strong/suggested/possible)
link_score
created_by (system/user)
created_at

7) Definition of Done (for Engineers)
A QA tester can:
do a 3-minute walkthrough with 15 photos and 1 video
speak 8 action items naturally
see within minutes:
transcript
tasks
80% correct auto-linking of tasks to the right photos/video
ability to fix the remaining links in under 2 minutes
export a PDF evidence package with tasks + photos + transcript excerpts

If you want, I can also output this as:
Jira epics + user stories + acceptance tests
a technical architecture diagram
or a v1/v2 roadmap (so you don’t overbuild before you prove workflow adoption).
